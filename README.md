//***FILE 480 is a collection of utilities from Baldomero Castilla  *   FILE 480
//*           of Madrid, Spain.  Baldomero can understand spoken    *   FILE 480
//*           English and written English, so he can support these  *   FILE 480
//*           programs.  But he can't write English, so all of the  *   FILE 480
//*           programs and utilities found here, are commented in   *   FILE 480
//*           Spanish.  I have translated Baldomero's general       *   FILE 480
//*           documentation into English, and if anyone needs a     *   FILE 480
//*           program translated, I guess I can try, without        *   FILE 480
//*           promising.  There's some very good code here, so if   *   FILE 480
//*           you think you can negotiate the Spanish, please give  *   FILE 480
//*           it a shot.  A translation of Baldomero's              *   FILE 480
