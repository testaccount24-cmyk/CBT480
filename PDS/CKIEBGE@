NOTES ABOUT THE CKIEBGEN PROGRAM:    (Sam Golob)

0.  When this program became "fully developed", I got to prefer
    its use over IBM's IEBGENER program, once IEBGENER started
    to use "system determined blocksize", and I felt a big loss
    of control.  With this program I have exquisite control of
    the blocksize of the output dataset.

1.  The original program was in member CKIEBGE0.  It was a very
    simple QSAM GET and PUT, which copied RECORDS (not blocks)
    from one dataset to another.  It was a very simple dataset
    copying program.

2.  I tried to add some "bells and whistles" to it, especially
    to add a SYSPRINT file that tells you what you copied from,
    and what you copied to, and how many records were copied.

3.  Since I was writing my "MVS Tools and Tricks of the Trade"
    column for "Technical Support" magazine (from NsSPA) at the
    time, I made a request for the readers to improve this
    program, as an exercise.  Warren Whitford took me up on it.

4.  The program went through eight iterations, and got much better.

5.  The current program produces a report, as follows:

CKIEBGEN - SEQUENTIAL COPY PROGRAM - LEVEL 009     03/12/2024  00:16:54
 JFCB REPORT OF DATASET CHARACTERISTICS
   SYSUT1 DSN = SBGOLOB.CBT.EDIT
      MEMBER  = FILE001
      VOLSER  = DATA02
      DSORG   = PO
      RECFM   = FB
      LRECL   =           80
      BLKSIZE =       27,920
   SYSUT2 DSN = SBGOLOB.TEST.DATA.PDS
      MEMBER  = FILE1PC
      VOLSER  = WORKA6
      DSORG   = PO
      RECFM   = FB
      LRECL   =           80
      BLKSIZE =       27,920

  RECORDS  IN =               94,447
  RECORDS OUT =               94,447


6.  I had a need to add a partial copy capability, so I added
    SKIP=mmmm and COPY=nnnn capability to the program.  These
    quantities were entered in an optional SYSIN DD name.  The
    program can skip a certain number of RECORDS, and then copy
    a certain number of records, and then stop.

    For example, in the previous case, had I inserted a SYSIN
    DD card in the JCL, with the coding:

  //SYSIN DD *
  SKIP=1000
  COPY=1000
  /*

    Then the report (at the bottom) would have read as follows:

      BLKSIZE =       27,920

  RECORDS  IN =                2,001
  RECORDS OUT =                1,000
  SKIPPED     =                1,000
  COPIED      =                1,000
